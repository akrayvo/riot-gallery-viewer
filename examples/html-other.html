        <!--
        Galleries contain items. Each item has an image URL(full size), a clickable element, and a caption (optional).
        
        Simply add the "riot-gallery" class to any container element to make it a gallery.
        
        For lists (ul or ol), the default item containers are list items (li). For tables (table), the default item containers are cells (td).
        All other item containers must have the class "riot-gallery-item".
        
        Data can be specified through data attributes, classes, or defaults. For example, captions below are set by the data attribute
        of data-riot-gallery-caption, the class of riot-gallery-caption, or the tag of figcaption. See the readme.md file for more info.

        Note that data is set in various ways (data attributes, classes, etc) below as examples. Normally, all data in a gallery would
        be set the same way for consistency.
