        <!--
        Adding items/images is very flexible. Each item has an image URL(full size), a clickable element, and a caption (optional). 
        This is an example of a "gallery" that is set up in text rather than thumbnail images. Lists are filled with list items and 
        tables have cells, but since this gallery container is a paragraph tag (**p**), the item containers must be specified with 
        the **riot-gallery-item** class.

        Note that various methods (data attributes, classes, default, etc) are used to specify the image URL, clickable element, 
        and caption. Generally, you would only use 1 method, but this is example of the program's flexibility.
        see the "HTML setup" of the "readme.md" file for more information.
